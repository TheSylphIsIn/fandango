# Pokemon Snakewood: Resurrected

This is the repository for Snakewood: Resurrected, a Pokemon Snakewood reboot made using the pokeemerald decomp.

The game is playable up to Rusturf Tunnel (roughly one gym of content). This is a "demo" I made for April Fools Day 2023.

It is unlikely I will do any further development with this. Do with it what you wish.

# Pret Info

It builds the following ROM:
